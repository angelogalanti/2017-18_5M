	 1. Selectors and Visual Rules
		 - CSS Setup and Selectors
			 > 
			 > CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.
			> 
			> CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.
			> 
			> Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
			> 
			> Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
			> 
			> IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.
			> 
			> Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
			> 
			> Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
			> 
			> The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.
			> 
			> Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
			
		  - CSS Visual Rules
			   > CSS declarations are structured into property and value pairs.
			   > 
			   > The font-family property defines the typeface of an element.
			   > 
			   > font-size controls the size of text displayed.
			   > 
			   > font-weight defines how thin or thick text is displayed.
			   > 
			   > The text-align property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.
			   > 
			   > Text can have two different color attributes: color and background-color. color defines the color of the text, while background-color defines the color behind the text.
			   > 
			   > CSS can make an element transparent with the opacity property.
			   > 
			   > CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the background-image property.
	 2. The Box Model
 		  - The Box Model
			> The box model comprises a set of properties used to create space around and between HTML elements.
			>
			> The height and width of a content area can be set in pixels or percentage.
			>
			> Borders surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style, and thickness of a border can be set with CSS properties.
			>
			> Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be set in pixels or percent.
			>
			> Margin is the amount of spacing outside of an element's border.
			>
			> Horizontal margins add, so the total space between the borders of adjacent elements is equal to the sum of the right margin of one element and the left margin of the adjacent element.
			>
			> Vertical margins collapse, so the space between vertically adjacent elements is equal to the larger margin.
			>
			> margin: 0 auto horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area, if it has a width.
			>
			> The overflow property can be set to display, hide, or scroll, and dictates how HTML will render content that overflows its parent's content area.
			>
			> The visibility property can hide or show elements.
