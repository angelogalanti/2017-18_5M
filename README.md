	 1. Selectors and Visual Rules
		 - CSS Setup and Selectors
			 > 
			 > CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.
			> 
			> CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.
			> 
			> Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
			> 
			> Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
			> 
			> IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.
			> 
			> Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
			> 
			> Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
			> 
			> The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.
			> 
			> Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
			
		  - CSS Visual Rules
			   > CSS declarations are structured into property and value pairs.
			   > 
			   > The font-family property defines the typeface of an element.
			   > 
			   > font-size controls the size of text displayed.
			   > 
			   > font-weight defines how thin or thick text is displayed.
			   > 
			   > The text-align property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.
			   > 
			   > Text can have two different color attributes: color and background-color. color defines the color of the text, while background-color defines the color behind the text.
			   > 
			   > CSS can make an element transparent with the opacity property.
			   > 
			   > CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the background-image property.
